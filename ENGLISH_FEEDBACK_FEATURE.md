# English Feedback Feature Documentation

## Overview

The Debate Room Facilitator has been enhanced with comprehensive English language learning capabilities. The AI agent now provides detailed feedback on English usage alongside facilitating the discussion.

## New Features

### 1. English Language Feedback During Discussion

The facilitator now provides real-time feedback on:
- **Sentence structure and framing**: How well participants construct their sentences
- **Grammar**: Verb tenses, subject-verb agreement, articles, prepositions
- **Vocabulary**: Word choice and usage appropriateness
- **Clarity**: Overall coherence and effectiveness of communication

#### Format

Feedback is structured with clear sections:

```
FACILITATOR FEEDBACK
------------------------------------------------------------

**Discussion Feedback:**
[General observations about the discussion content, common ground, etc.]

**English Feedback:**
• **Participant Name**: [Specific feedback on grammar, sentence structure, etc.]
• **Participant Name**: [Specific feedback on their English usage]
• **Participant Name**: [Constructive suggestions for improvement]

------------------------------------------------------------
```

### 2. Configurable Number of Rounds

You can now set a specific number of discussion rounds at the start.

**During Setup:**
```
Number of rounds [3]: 5
```

The discussion will automatically conclude after the specified number of rounds, ensuring a structured learning experience.

**Benefits:**
- Predictable session duration
- Better time management
- Consistent practice opportunity for all participants

### 3. Final English Learning Summary

At the end of the discussion (after all rounds complete or upon early exit), participants receive a comprehensive English learning summary.

#### Summary Structure

For each participant, the summary includes:

**[Participant Name] - English Learning Summary:**
- **Strengths**: What they did well in English usage
- **Areas for Improvement**: Specific patterns that need attention
- **Progress Observed**: Improvements noticed during the discussion
- **Tips for Continued Growth**: 2-3 actionable suggestions

#### Example Output

```

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes

#### 1. DebateRoomFacilitator Class

**New Parameters:**
```python
def __init__(self, room_type: str = "discussion", num_rounds: int = 3):
    self.num_rounds = num_rounds
    self.english_feedback_history = {}
```

**New Methods:**
```python
def get_final_english_summary(self) -> str:
    """Generate comprehensive English learning summary for each participant."""
    
def _extract_and_store_english_feedback(self, response: str, recent_statements: list):
    """Track English feedback throughout the discussion."""
```

#### 2. Enhanced System Prompt

The agent's system prompt now includes:
```python
- **ENGLISH FEEDBACK**: Provide specific feedback on English language use including:
  * Sentence structure and framing
  * Grammar corrections (tense, subject-verb agreement, articles, prepositions)
  * Vocabulary usage and word choice
  * Clarity and coherence of expression
```

#### 3. Structured Response Format

The agent is instructed to format responses with:
- Clear section headers
- Bullet points for each participant
- Specific, actionable feedback

### Data Tracking

**English Feedback History:**
```python
self.english_feedback_history = {
    "Alice": [
        {"round": 1, "feedback_received": True},
        {"round": 2, "feedback_received": True}
    ],
    "Bob": [...]
}
```

## Configuration Options

### Adjusting Feedback Detail Level

You can modify the system prompt in `debate_room_facilitator.py` to adjust:
- Level of detail in grammar corrections

- Tone (more/less formal)

### Changing Default Rounds

In `debate_room_facilitator.py`:
```python
def __init__(self, room_type: str = "discussion", num_rounds: int = 3):
    # Change default from 3 to your preferred number
```

### Customizing Summary Format

Modify the prompt in `get_final_english_summary()` method to change:
- Summary structure
- Focus areas
- Level of encouragement vs criticism

## Testing

### Updated Tests

The test suite now verifies:
```python
# Test default rounds
facilitator = DebateRoomFacilitator(room_type="discussion")
assert facilitator.num_rounds == 3

# Test custom rounds
facilitator2 = DebateRoomFacilitator(room_type="debate", num_rounds=5)
assert facilitator2.num_rounds == 5

# Test English feedback tracking structure
assert facilitator.english_feedback_history == {}
```

Run tests with:
```bash
python3 test_debate_room.py
```

**Discussion Feedback:**
Good start to the discussion. Both participants are engaging with 
the topic of AI's impact on the world.

**English Feedback:**
• **Alice**: Your idea is clear! Small grammar note: "AI is changing" 
  (present continuous) is better than "AI is change" here. Also, 
  "many ways" (plural) instead of "many way."
• **Bob**: Good point! Watch subject-verb agreement: "we need" 
  (not "needs"). Also "these changes" (plural) instead of "this changes."

------------------------------------------------------------


--- Round 2 of 2 ---

**Discussion Feedback:**
Excellent progression! You're both building on the discussion and 
moving toward specific areas like healthcare and education.

**English Feedback:**
• **Alice**: Perfect correction! Your sentence is now grammatically 
  correct and clear. Good use of the present continuous tense.
• **Bob**: Excellent improvement! Your grammar is now correct. Nice 
  use of "through education" to show the method.
