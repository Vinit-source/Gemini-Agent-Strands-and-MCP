## Scenario 2: Standard 3-Round Session (Intermediate)

### Setup
```
Room type: discussion
Number of participants: 3
Number of rounds: 3
Participants: Carlos, Diana, Emma
Topic: Climate change: Individual responsibility vs. corporate accountability
```

### Round 1

**Carlos:** I think that corporations has more responsibility than individuals because they pollute much more.

**Diana:** While I agree corporations pollute more, individual actions are adding up to make difference.

**Emma:** We need both, but government regulation is most important for forcing corporations to change.

**Facilitator Feedback:**
```
**Discussion Feedback:**
Strong opening round! All three of you have introduced different but 
complementary perspectives. The discussion is well-balanced.

**English Feedback:**
• **Carlos**: Clear argument! Grammar note: "corporations have" (plural 
  subject needs plural verb). Also, "they pollute much more" - perfect!
• **Diana**: Good use of "while" to show contrast! Small addition needed: 
  "adding up to make A difference" or "adding up to make differences."
• **Emma**: Strong sentence! Just one tweak: "most important for forcing" 
  is good, but "for forcing" could be "to force" (infinitive).
```

### Round 2

**Carlos:** You're right, Diana. Corporations have more power and resources, so they must take the lead.

**Diana:** Exactly! But if everyone makes small changes, like reducing plastic use, these add up to make a real difference.

**Emma:** I agree with both points. However, government regulations to force corporations would create the biggest impact quickly.

**Facilitator Feedback:**
```
**Discussion Feedback:**
Excellent progression! You're building on each other's points while 
maintaining your perspectives. The phrase "add up" is being used well 
to show cumulative effect.

**English Feedback:**
• **Carlos**: Perfect grammar correction! "Corporations have" - well done. 
  Good use of "so" to show consequence. Clear and concise.
• **Diana**: Great improvement! "These add up to make a real difference" 
  is perfect. Excellent vocabulary with "reducing plastic use."
• **Emma**: Good adjustment! "Regulations to force" works well. Your use 
  of "however" as a transition is professional.
```

### Round 3

**Carlos:** Perhaps we need a combination approach where government sets regulations, corporations implement them, and individuals support through their choices.

**Diana:** I like that synthesis! If we all work together at different levels, we can address climate change more effectively.

**Emma:** That's a comprehensive solution. The key is ensuring accountability at each level through monitoring and enforcement.

**Facilitator Feedback:**
```
**Discussion Feedback:**
Outstanding convergence! You've moved from individual perspectives to a 
synthesized solution. This demonstrates excellent collaborative thinking.

**English Feedback:**
• **Carlos**: Sophisticated sentence! "Combination approach" is excellent 
  vocabulary. Your use of "where" to introduce the explanation is perfect.
• **Diana**: "Synthesis" - great vocabulary! Perfect grammar throughout. 
  Your phrase "at different levels" shows nuanced thinking.
• **Emma**: Professional language! "Comprehensive," "ensuring," "monitoring" 
  - all excellent word choices. Grammar is flawless.
```
